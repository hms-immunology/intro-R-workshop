## Introduction

In R, we work with objects to store and manipulate data. Understanding how to create and work with objects is fundamental to using R effectively. This lesson will cover the basics of working with objects and variables in R, using examples relevant to medical and health sciences, including RNA sequencing analysis.

## Creating Objects

In R, we create objects using the assignment operator `<-` (or `=`). The basic syntax is:

```{r basic-objects}
# Creating a numeric object (gene expression value)
expression_level <- 1543.7

# Creating a text (character) object
gene_name <- "BRCA1"

# Creating a logical object
is_differentially_expressed <- TRUE

# Let's print our objects
print("Expression level:")
print(expression_level)
print("Gene name:")
print(gene_name)
print("Is differentially expressed?")
print(is_differentially_expressed)
```

### Pro Tip
In RStudio, you can type `Alt + -` (Windows/Linux) or `Option + -` (Mac) to create the assignment operator `<-` in one keystroke!

## Naming Conventions

When naming objects in R, follow these guidelines:

✅ **Good Names:**
- Use descriptive names: `read_count`, `expression_level`
- Start with letters: `gene_1`, `sample_id`
- Use underscores for spaces: `fold_change`

❌ **Avoid:**
- Starting with numbers: `2nd_replicate` (invalid)
- Using spaces: `gene expression` (invalid)
- Using special characters: `gene@1` (invalid)
- Using R reserved words: `if`, `else`, `function`

## Working with Objects

Once you create an object, you can use it in calculations or operations:

```{r calculations}
# RNA-seq example: calculating fold change
control_expression <- 100
treated_expression <- 200
fold_change <- treated_expression / control_expression
print("Fold change:")
print(fold_change)  # This will print: 2

# Medical example: BMI calculation
weight_kg <- 70.5
height_m <- 1.75
bmi <- weight_kg / (height_m^2)
print("BMI calculation:")
print(bmi)  # This will print: 23.02
```

## Practice Challenges

### Challenge 1: Basic Calculations
Try to predict the values after each operation:

```{r challenge1}
read_count <- 1000       # What is read_count?
scaling_factor <- 1.5    # What is scaling_factor?
read_count <- read_count * scaling_factor  # Now what is read_count?
normalized_count <- read_count / 10     # What is normalized_count?

# Let's print the results
print("Final read count:")
print(read_count)
print("Normalized count:")
print(normalized_count)
```

### Challenge 2: Temperature Conversion
Convert a patient's temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula: °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32

```{r challenge2}
# Convert temperature
temp_celsius <- 37.5  # Normal body temperature
temp_fahrenheit <- (temp_celsius * 9/5) + 32

print("Temperature conversion:")
print(paste(temp_celsius, "°C =", temp_fahrenheit, "°F"))
```

### Challenge 3: Sample Information
Create three variables and combine them into a single sentence:

```{r challenge3}
sample_id <- "RNA_01"
gene_name <- "TP53"
expression_value <- 2456

message <- paste("Sample", sample_id, "shows", expression_value, "counts for gene", gene_name)
print("Combined message:")
print(message)
```

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

1. **Case Sensitivity**
```{r case-sensitivity}
# These are three different objects!
expression <- 5000
Expression <- 6000
EXPRESSION <- 7000

print("Three different variables:")
print(expression)
print(Expression)
print(EXPRESSION)
```

2. **Overwriting Objects**
```{r overwriting}
read_depth <- 1000000
print("Original read depth:")
print(read_depth)

read_depth <- 1500000  # The original value (1000000) is now gone
print("New read depth:")
print(read_depth)
```

3. **Invalid Names**
```{r invalid-names, eval=FALSE}
# This won't work:
1st_sample <- 5  # Invalid: starts with number
sample name <- "Control"  # Invalid: contains space
```

## Tips for Success

1. Always use clear, descriptive names for your objects
2. Be consistent with your naming style (e.g., `gene_name`, `sample_id`)
3. Check your objects exist by typing their name
4. Use the `ls()` function to see all objects in your environment
5. Use `rm(object_name)` to remove objects you no longer need

```{r tips}
# List all objects in environment
print("Objects in environment:")
ls()

# Remove an object
rm(expression)
print("Objects after removing 'expression':")
ls()
```

## Next Steps

After mastering basic objects and variables, you can move on to:
- Working with data vectors and matrices
- Understanding data types and structures
- Learning how to create and use functions
- Working with data frames
